I update these to use with [JAGFx](https://github.com/JAGFx/ets2-dashboard-skin) on a secondary monitor, so I don't have a vanilla ETS2 map here as I only use ProMods.
If you use JAGFx yourself, you may use these as a custom tileset by entering the raw json urls below each version above into the map config settings.
